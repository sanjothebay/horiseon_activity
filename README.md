This is my first homework assignment given to us by Technology de Monterrey Mexico Coding.
The instruction given to us was to use semantic elements instead of divs. To fix the HTML with the CSS with a working website.
I pulled the work from the Tech Monterrey Gitlab then I created my repository for the project to modify the HTML and the CSS.
I started by fixing the link for "search-engine-optimization" by adding an id to the div for the link to work. 
I then started my way down from div to div.
While working with a live server to make sure that the changes on each div would not affect the functionality and the presentation of the web page.
Making sure throughout each change of each process the web worked great without any errors before committing to the change. 
This is a list of each semantic element used instead of a div. I proceeded to remove the img class, leaving just the id tag and use that id tag in the CSS.
The nav for the navigation links. The span for the different sections of the h1. main for the main section of the web page.
I added an article since there was 3 section with a description of the section. Then I added figure to separate the two other sections with the article as there was a different 
style for this in the CSS. I added aside for a side section note section was then add to the HTML as again a notice a section with 3 different sections and section would be 
perfect for this part. the footer was for the bottom part of the web page and what perfect semantic elements to use than the footer. strong was then added to the note at the 
bottom of the page. the summary semantic elements were added for the man picture, making sure that it would not change the style of the web page. I also added an alt= with a 
description for the image for blind users as this will be read to them. During this process, the CSS also changed to make sure the functionality of the web page. the last part I 
did was clean up the CSS as much as I could.
In conclusion, I remove all the div and only use semantic elements for the web page. NO errors came up and the web page is working and functioning well.
